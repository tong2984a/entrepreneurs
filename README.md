To all friends in my entrepreneurs circle who want to boss your software development in today's remote working environment, here are some straightforward steps for you to put into practice (i.e. a 10,000 foot view):

- Checkpoint 1: Are you in control of your own product?

- Checkpoint 2: Does it work?

- Checkpoint 3: Show me the data.

Let me elaborate further:
# Checkpoint 1
- More often than not, your engineers put source code and/or all your business crown jewels in git. 
- People use various tools to turn source code into customer-facing product(s). 
- You know you are in good shape if you have the capability to build a duplicate of your product within a reasonable time frame (e.g. for demo purpose, QA purpose, etc).

# Checkpoint 2
- Let's cut to the chase. Show me 10 test cases.
- Great, now that you have 10 test cases, show me the test results.
- Great, now that all your 10 test cases pass with flying colors, when do you plan to repeat the test?
- The take away point is that quality ought to be repeatable. Automation is cheap / free these days so use this to your advantage as an owner.

# Checkpoint 3
- Simply put, you ought to be in control of your data, because they are both assets and liabilities.
- There are 2 ways of looking at it. You can think like an engineer or you can think like a business owner. One way is you take your data to test your software. The other is you take your software to test your data.
- You know you are in good shape if you are able to take the checkpoint #1 software and checkpoint #2 test cases to verify your production data.

Why a legal disclaimer? Am I being paranoid? There are plenty of data-related legal and compliance issues that you should not take lightly. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions.
